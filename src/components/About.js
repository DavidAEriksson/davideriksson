					My name is David Eriksson, I am currently studying for my masters
					degree
					<br /> in{" "}
					<a href="http://interaktion.nu/">
						Interaction Technology and Design at Ume√• University
					</a>{" "}
					in Sweden and also
					<br /> very recently at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
					<br /> I've loved computers and technology all my life, but it was
					during my university
					<br /> studies that I found my passion for creating elegant solutions
					for
					<br /> web and mobile applications.
					<br />
					<br /> I'm currently working alot in React.js, Cloud Firestore and
					React-Native on <br />
					projects that will be displayed more thoroughly in the 'Projects'
					section <br />
					of this page. In the meantime I've left links to some of selected past{" "}
					<br />
					projects down in the 'Projects' section that you can look through. In
					the 'Contact' <br />
					section you can find all of my socials if you want to contact me, I'm
					always <br />
					up for work so if you're interested I've left my resume as a
					downloadable file there <br />
					as well.
